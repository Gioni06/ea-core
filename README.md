# Improve Download Speeds in EA's Origin Software

Using this file enables Origins "Research &amp; Development" mode.

## Why

If you experience low downloads speeds when using EA's Origin software it can dramatically improve the download rates for Game downloads and updates.

## Usage

- Download the `EACore` file.
- Place the file in the root folder of your Origin installation. Typically `C:\Program Files (x86)\Origin`
- If ask to override the current file proceed with "yes"
- Restart Origin

## Disable "Research &amp; Development" mode
- Open the file with a Text Editor and delete its content.
- Restart Origin

## Whats next

Cross fingers and hope that you get improved download speeds. There is no guarantee that it works. EA is constantly working on Origin and it might very well stop to work in the future.
